Plasticity is still in early BETA. So please bear in mind it's missing many features and not yet easy to use or install.

## CAD for artists

Plasticity is a 3d modelling software for concept artists. Modelling in Plasticity is quick and efficient due to the unique gizmos, shortcuts, and thoughtful workflow.

The goal of plasticity is to make working with NURBS like working with clay.

**Plasticity is currently in BETA. It has a ton of bugs and missing features.**

## License

Plasticity is COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE. It will cost money to buy when it reaches 1.0.

The code in this repository is licensed under the LGPL. To goal is to allow users to inspect the source and (in the future) allow users to make their own modifications and/or develop plugins.

HOWEVER, it dynamically links with a commercial software that I have licensed for $$$$$$$$. That license imposes many restrictions on how the app can be distributed and what functionality is available to end users. Please do not redistribute the binary.

#### FAQ

**I am currently handling bugs and offering support only through Discord. You can email me for an invite.**
